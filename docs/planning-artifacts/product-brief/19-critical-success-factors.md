# 19. Critical Success Factors

1. **Customer Validation First** — 20–30 pre-sales conversations before MVP development
2. **Compliance Is Non-Negotiable** — NDPA + GAID. Privacy Proxy from Day 1. DPO hired.
3. **Channel Diversification** — Never be 100% dependent on Meta. Telegram/RCS/SMS fallback built into architecture.
4. **Cost Discipline** — AI cost monitoring from Day 1. Semantic caching, model routing, prompt optimization.
5. **Quality Over Features** — Reliable automation > breadth. AI output quality = user brand trust.
6. **BSUID Readiness** — Identity resolution schema designed for multi-identifier from Day 1.
7. **Start Simple, Scale Smart** — Modular monolith first. No premature Kubernetes.
