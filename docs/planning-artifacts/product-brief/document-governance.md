# Document Governance

**Authority & precedence for planning conflicts:** `architecture > ux spec > prd > ux html > product-brief`.

- This brief is intentionally lower-precedence than architecture, UX spec, PRD, and UX HTML artifacts.
- In implementation conflicts, follow `architecture.md`, then `ux-design-specification.md`, then `prd.md`, then `ux-design-directions.html`/`ux-color-themes.html`.
- This document provides product strategy context and must not override canonical implementation standards.
