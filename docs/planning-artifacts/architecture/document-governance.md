# Document Governance

**Authority & precedence for planning conflicts:** `architecture > ux spec > prd > ux html > product-brief`.

- This document is the canonical implementation authority for technical decisions, boundaries, and standards.
- `docs/project-context.md` is a derived implementation contract and must not override this document.
- When downstream documents conflict with this document, this document wins unless explicitly superseded here.
