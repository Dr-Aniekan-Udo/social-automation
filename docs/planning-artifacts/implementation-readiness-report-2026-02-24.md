NFR-S11: Cross-tenant data leak triggers immediate: (1) affected tenant isolation within 60 seconds, (2) admin alert within 60 seconds, (3) affected data audit within 4 hours. Breach reporting to NDPC within 72 hours per NDPA Article 40
NFR-SC1: System architecture supports horizontal scaling from 100 users (beta) to 10,000 users without architecture changes
NFR-SC2: Database design supports seamless migration from shared multi-tenant to dedicated per-tenant instances for enterprise accounts
NFR-SC3: AI request queue handles burst traffic (10x normal) by queueing with priority (paid tier > free tier) and graceful degradation
NFR-SC4: Image/media storage scales independently of application servers, using object storage (S3-compatible) with CDN distribution
NFR-SC5: Background job processing (KYC verification, analytics aggregation, notification delivery) scales independently via worker pool
NFR-SC6: API design supports pagination, cursor-based navigation, and field filtering to prevent over-fetching as data grows
NFR-SC7: When concurrent user threshold is approached (80%), system activates request queuing. At 100%, new logins are queued with 'high demand' wait screen. System never crashes â€” always degrades gracefully
NFR-R1: Platform targets 99.5% uptime (~3.65 hours/month planned maintenance), measured monthly
NFR-R1a: Payment-related endpoints target 99.9% availability using Paystack/Flutterwave dual-gateway resilience (Phase 2+)

NFR-R12: System monitors settlement SLAs from payment providers. If settlement exceeds 24-hour SLA, proactive seller notification sent with expected resolution date. Admin dashboard shows settlement health
NFR-R13: Dispute acknowledgment within 4 hours (automated). Admin mediation response within 48 hours. Dispute resolution (decision rendered) within 7 business days
NFR-R14: Critical notifications (payment received, security alert, billing event) have guaranteed delivery: primary channel + fallback within 5 minutes. Non-critical (engagement prompt) best-effort, single channel
NFR-I1: All third-party integrations use adapter/provider pattern â€” adding a new payment gateway, KYC provider, AI model, or messaging service requires implementing an interface, not modifying core logic
NFR-I2: Webhook endpoints process inbound events within 5 seconds and return HTTP 200; failed processing retried from dead letter queue
NFR-I3: Social media API rate limits monitored in real-time with automatic throttling at 80% of limit ceiling

NFR-M5: Initial page payload â‰¤ 500KB compressed. Subsequent page navigations â‰¤ 100KB. Service worker caching for offline-tolerant patterns
NFR-M6: Application supports offline-tolerant patterns: optimistic UI updates only for reversible actions (with undo), background sync when connectivity returns, and delivery-confirmed states (`sending` â†’ `delivered`/`failed`) for irreversible sends
NFR-M7: Offline-to-online sync conflicts resolved via last-write-wins with conflict notification to all parties. Seller sees 'This was changed while you were offline' alert with option to keep their version or the current version
NFR-AI1: System supports pluggable AI provider pattern with 3 tiers: Tier 1 (self-hosted 7B model for simple tasks â€” classification, routing, tagging), Tier 2 (RAG-optimized API for knowledge grounding â€” customer summaries, Brand Voice calibration), Tier 3 (premium API for creative content â€” caption generation, content strategy). Models switchable per tier without application changes
NFR-AI2: AI request router classifies task complexity and routes to appropriate tier. Routing decision adds â‰¤ 100ms latency. Routing classifier itself runs on Tier 1 (self-hosted)
NFR-AI3: Per-tier latency targets: Tier 1 (self-hosted) â‰¤ 2 seconds for simple tasks, Tier 2 (RAG API) â‰¤ 4 seconds for grounded generation, Tier 3 (creative API) â‰¤ 5 seconds p95 / 10 seconds p99 for creative content. All tiers support fallback to next tier on failure

Total NFRs: 66

### Additional Requirements

- Document precedence constraint: when planning conflicts occur, follow architecture > ux spec > prd > ux html > product-brief.
- Phase-scope constraint: Phase 1 (MVP) is an 8-week, 4-sprint delivery with Instagram-first baseline and conditional WhatsApp inclusion based on API approval timing.
- Pre-sprint dependency: WhatsApp Business API application must be submitted by Week -2; if delayed beyond Week 4, ship IG-only baseline and activate WhatsApp post-approval.
- Architecture prerequisite constraint: Link router data pipeline (URL generation + click logging) must exist in Phase 1 to enable Phase 2 cross-platform attribution.
- Architecture prerequisite constraint: Paystack subaccount model must be in place in Phase 1 to allow Phase 2 escrow without major refactor.
- Degraded-mode business continuity requirement: when Paystack health checks fail, system must provide temporary bank-transfer flow and auto-recover when health returns.
- Compliance/legal constraints: NDPA consent logging, deletion SLA, and breach-notification readiness are required; CBN/FCCPC alignment constraints are explicitly defined in PRD domain requirements.
- Market-regulation constraint: prohibited categories must be blocked, and regulated categories (e.g., food/cosmetics) require verification before first sale.
- Tenant model constraint: hybrid multi-tenant isolation is required (shared-DB tenant isolation for normal accounts; dedicated DB path for enterprise accounts).
- Billing lifecycle constraint: grace-period/downgrade/suspension/deletion flow is explicitly defined and must preserve notification-before-deletion behavior.
- Feature-gating constraint: limits are server-enforced; buyer-initiated messages are never blocked even when seller-initiated quotas are exhausted.
- Assumption-gate constraint before scale: top assumptions (AI uplift, willingness to pay, platform API stability) require explicit validation gates before scaling beyond first 100 users.

### PRD Completeness Assessment

- Completeness: Strong and comprehensive for functional scope; FR catalog is explicit and contiguous (FR1 to FR112) with clear domain partitioning.
- Quality level: NFR set is measurable and testable, spanning performance, security, scalability, reliability, integration, mobile/localization, and AI architecture (NFR-P1 ... NFR-AI3).
- Traceability readiness: High, because FR/NFR identifiers are well-structured for requirement-to-epic mapping in subsequent steps.
- Risk note: PRD contains explicit untested assumptions and phased dependencies; these do not block analysis but must be validated and represented in epic/story coverage and implementation sequencing.

### Missing Requirements

- No PRD FR gaps detected in epic coverage mapping.

#### FRs In Epics But Not In PRD
- None detected.

### Coverage Statistics

- Total PRD FRs: 112
- FRs covered in epics: 112
- Coverage percentage: 100%


## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

- Found: docs/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification/index.md (sharded UX spec present with supporting UX files).

### Alignment Issues

- **Phase boundary tension (analytics UI):** PRD/UX specify contextual MVP metrics with dedicated analytics dashboards deferred to Growth, but architecture structure includes a dedicated (dashboard)/analytics/page.tsx route. Ensure this route is feature-gated or deferred from MVP release scope.
- **Phase boundary tension (scheduling UI):** PRD/UX defer full calendar views beyond MVP, but architecture references ContentCalendar.tsx in publishing coverage. Confirm MVP uses feed-native queue only and calendar capability is held for post-MVP.
- **UX requirement explicitness gap (voice-first/audio preview):** UX emphasizes voice-first content creation and audio preview as trust/accessibility-critical; PRD functional catalog does not explicitly define audio preview behavior as a functional requirement. Add explicit traceability in epics/stories to avoid omission.
- **UX requirement explicitness gap (publish trust gate):** UX proposes a per-post “Sounds Like Me” rating gate before publish, while PRD currently specifies Brand Voice scoring/warnings (FR24) without a strict publish gate requirement. Clarify if this is mandatory MVP behavior or optional enhancement.

### Warnings

- UX documentation exists and is detailed; no missing-UX warning applies.
- Several UX opportunities are marked as Growth/Scale innovations. Keep them out of MVP implementation planning unless they are explicitly tied to MVP FRs.
- Architecture largely supports UX non-functional needs (mobile-first, 3G performance, skeleton loading, offline tolerance), but enforcement should include testable acceptance criteria in stories so UX constraints are not lost during implementation.


## Epic Quality Review

### Validation Scope

- Epics reviewed: 13 (epic-list.md + full stories.md)
- Stories reviewed: 96
- Story template compliance (As a / I want / So that + AC header + Given/When/Then): 100%
- Forward story dependencies detected: 0

### ?? Critical Violations

1. **Technical epics used as primary product epics (no direct user value):** Epic 1, Epic 2, and Epic 3 are infrastructure milestones with FRs covered: None (Foundational/Additional).
   - Evidence: docs/planning-artifacts/epics/epic-list.md:3, :16, :26 and corresponding FR coverage lines :7, :20, :30.
   - Why this violates standards: create-epics-and-stories guidance requires user-value epics; technical setup should be treated as enablers/prerequisites, not user outcome epics.
   - Remediation: Move Epics 1-3 to a prerequisite track (or relabel as Enabler Epics) with explicit exit criteria and keep user-value epics as the primary delivery sequence.

2. **FR-to-story semantic mismatch (false coverage) for FR79 and FR80:**
   - PRD definitions:
     - FR79 = emergency Pause Auto-Replies
     - FR80 = stale product-catalog warning after 6+ hours
   - Evidence: docs/planning-artifacts/prd/functional-requirements.md:105-106
   - Story 11.5 is Workload-Based Auto-Assignment but claims FR79, FR80 coverage.
   - Evidence: docs/planning-artifacts/epics/stories.md:1808, :1814, :1821
   - Why this is critical: readiness report currently shows 100% FR coverage, but these two FRs are not implemented by matching story behavior.
   - Remediation: Create/adjust stories so FR79 and FR80 are implemented explicitly (pause auto-replies control + stale catalog warning), then remap Story 11.5 to additional scope or a different FR.

### ?? Major Issues

1. **Traceability dilution from high volume of non-FR stories:**
   - 37/96 stories are marked None (Foundational/Additional).
   - 14 of these occur inside feature epics (4+), increasing ambiguity in scope control and acceptance.
   - Examples: Story 4.3, 4.6, 4.7, 6.1, 6.2, 6.9, 6.10, 8.2, 8.3, 8.6, 9.2, 10.6.
   - Remediation: map each non-FR story to either (a) explicit NFR(s), (b) architecture decision ID, or (c) enabler tag with clear definition of done.

2. **Migration naming rule conflict between stories and architecture standards:**
   - Story 2.3 requires NNNN_description.up.sql naming.
   - Architecture standards require timestamp format YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.
   - Evidence: docs/planning-artifacts/epics/stories.md:199 vs docs/planning-artifacts/architecture/implementation-patterns-consistency-rules.md:327 and :341.
   - Remediation: normalize Story 2.3 acceptance criteria to architecture canonical migration naming.

3. **Scope creep risk in AI epic through unmapped advanced stories:**
   - Stories 6.9 and 6.10 add advanced image/layout capabilities but remain unmapped to PRD FRs.
   - Remediation: either map to approved requirements (or a planned Growth phase requirement) or move out of MVP implementation sequence.

### ?? Minor Concerns

1. **Cross-reference inconsistency in FR ownership:**
   - Story 6.8 references “FR69 mechanism from Epic 10,” but FR69 belongs to Growth Insights (Epic 12 mapping).
   - Evidence: docs/planning-artifacts/epics/stories.md:1018.
   - Remediation: correct reference text to avoid planning confusion.

2. **Dependency metadata is implicit in acceptance criteria text:**
   - Backward dependencies are present and valid, but mostly embedded in AC prose.
   - Remediation: add explicit Depends on: field per story for planning-tool friendliness and less ambiguity in sprint sequencing.

### Best-Practice Compliance Checklist (Step 5)

- [ ] Epic delivers user value (fails for Epics 1-3)
- [x] Epic independence from future epics (no forward epic dependency detected)
- [x] Stories are generally right-sized and structurally complete (template + BDD present)
- [x] No forward story dependencies detected
- [x] Database creation timing is mostly incremental (base schema + progressive additions)
- [ ] Traceability to requirements is fully reliable (fails due to FR79/FR80 semantic mismatch and high non-FR story volume)


## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

NOT READY

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

- Convert foundational technical epics (Epics 1-3) into an explicit enabler/prerequisite track or refactor them into user-value epics before sprint execution.
- Correct FR79/FR80 semantic coverage: current Story 11.5 does not implement emergency Pause Auto-Replies or stale-catalog warning behavior despite claiming both FRs.
- Re-run FR traceability validation after remapping stories to ensure coverage is semantically accurate, not only numerically complete.

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Refactor epic taxonomy: separate product-value epics from enabling technical tracks, then re-sequence implementation order.
2. Add/adjust stories to explicitly implement FR79 and FR80, and remove incorrect FR tags from unrelated auto-assignment scope.
3. Normalize standards conflicts (e.g., migration naming convention) so stories and architecture rules are consistent before development begins.
4. Tag all None (Foundational/Additional) stories with explicit NFR/ADR/enabler references and acceptance evidence.
5. Re-run check-implementation-readiness after fixes and confirm readiness status before starting Sprint Planning.

### Final Note

This assessment identified 11 substantive issues across 3 severity categories (2 critical, 3 major, 2 minor, plus 4 UX/phase alignment issues). Address the critical issues before proceeding to implementation. The findings can be used to improve artifacts, or you may proceed with explicit risk acceptance.
