# Document Governance

**Authority & precedence for planning conflicts:** `architecture > ux spec > prd > ux html > product-brief`.

- This document must align to architecture and UX-spec canonical decisions.
- When this document conflicts with `architecture.md` or `ux-design-specification.md`, those higher-precedence documents win.
- UX HTML artifacts are visual references and do not override this document.
