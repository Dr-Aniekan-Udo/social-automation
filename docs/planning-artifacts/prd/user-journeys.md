# User Journeys

### Journey 1: Amaka's First Sale (Primary User — Success Path)

**Persona:** Amaka Okafor | Fashion Designer | Lagos | 3,200 IG followers | ₦200-350K/month
**Platform:** Instagram (primary), WhatsApp (customer conversations)

##### Opening Scene — Monday, 11:47 PM
Amaka is sitting on her bed in Yaba, scrolling through her phone. She has 14 new fabric samples that arrived today and knows she needs to photograph and post them tomorrow. Her eyes are heavy. She has 23 unanswered DMs — at least 5 look like serious buyers. She glances at her competitor's page — @shade_fabrics. Shade posted beautifully styled photos at 7 AM and has 340 likes. Amaka's last post was 3 days ago — 67 likes. Her friend Adaeze sent her a MarketBoss link two days ago. ₦5,000/month is a lot. But she lost at least ₦40,000 in unanswered DMs this week.

##### Rising Action — Tuesday through Thursday

- **Day 1 (Tuesday, 8:12 AM):** Signs up. Brand Voice Onboarding asks her to paste 5 of her best captions — casual, warm, sprinkled with "babes." Baseline captured: 3,200 followers, 2.1% engagement rate, avg 67 likes/post over last 30 days. She uploads 6 ankara photos. AI generates captions — first version too corporate. She clicks Regenerate. Second version: *"Babes, this ankara pattern just landed and I can't stop staring 😍 Comment 'PRICE' if you need this in your life."* She grins. Schedules 3 posts for 6:45 PM (AI-suggested optimal time).
- **Day 2 (Wednesday, 7:05 PM):** First AI post goes live while Amaka is at dinner. 4 comments in 30 minutes. DM comes in. MarketBoss captures the inquiry, creates a lead card, she sends a payment link (₦12,500 for 2 yards + delivery). Customer pays via Paystack. **Time to first sale: 1 day, 11 hours.**
- **Day 3 (Thursday):** Second post goes live. 3 more inquiries. Growth Assist notification: *"6 people commented but you haven't replied yet. Engaging increases reach by 15-30%."* She replies.

##### Edge Scene — "Is This AI?" (Day 5)
A follower comments: *"Amaka since when you dey write long caption like this? 😂 Na AI?"* Amaka panics. She checks the post — the AI caption IS more polished than her usual style, but the regenerated version matches her voice. She adds a personal reply: *"Lmao no o! But I've been stepping up my game 😌"* The comment thread generates 8 more likes. The AI's content variation keeps subsequent posts feeling different enough that no pattern is detectable.

##### Cross-Platform Tracking
A customer discovers Amaka's ankara on Instagram, but sends a WhatsApp message to order (the number is in Amaka's IG bio). MarketBoss captures the cross-platform journey: IG post → WhatsApp DM → payment link → completed sale. Full attribution chain preserved.

##### Climax — End of Week 1
4 posts published, 12 customer inquiries (all tracked and attributed), 5 completed sales = ₦47,500 revenue. Engagement: 2.1% → 3.8%. 43 new followers. Time saved: ~7 hours.

##### Resolution — Week 2+
Upgrades to Growth plan in Week 3. Posting 5x/week consistently. Followers crossed 3,800. Added sister as team member to handle DMs. Monthly revenue up ₦85,000. She tells every vendor at the market — though she initially feels a twinge of guilt that she's "cheating" while peers spend hours on content. That guilt fades as her revenue grows.

> **Requirements Revealed:** Brand Voice Onboarding (min 5 captions), pre-MarketBoss baseline capture, AI content generation with Regenerate, smart scheduling, automated inquiry capture (DM → Lead Card), payment link generation, Growth Assist engagement prompts, post-attribution analytics, cross-platform inquiry tracking (IG → WhatsApp → payment), content variation for AI detection resistance, team member invitation.

### Journey 2: Chinedu's WhatsApp Struggle (Primary User — Edge Case)

**Persona:** Chinedu Nwosu | Phone Accessories Dealer | Computer Village, Ikeja | ₦150-250K/month
**Platform:** WhatsApp (primary), Instagram (occasional)

##### Opening Scene — Saturday, 2:30 PM
Computer Village is chaos. Chinedu sits behind a glass counter stacked with phone cases and charging cables. His phone buzzes every 30 seconds — WhatsApp messages, customer inquiries, supplier quotes. He has 7 WhatsApp groups and 89 contacts in his broadcast list. He doesn't really use Instagram — tried it once, got 12 likes, abandoned it. His neighbor Kelechi showed him MarketBoss.

##### Rising Action — Signup and Friction

- **Hour 1:** Signs up, picks WhatsApp as primary pipeline. Brand Voice capture: terse and practical — *"iPhone 15 case, original leather, ₦4,500. Colors: black, brown, wine. DM 'ORDER' to buy."* **Friction 1:** WhatsApp Business API verification takes 2-6 weeks (realistic timeline). Instagram set as fallback. Chinedu is annoyed but tries it — uploads 10 product photos.
- **Day 14 (Growth mode):** WhatsApp API finally approved. Catalog synced. Broadcast tooling (Growth phase) generates campaign messages: *"New stock alert 🔥 iPhone 15 Pro cases just arrived. Leather finish, 3 colors. ₦4,500 only. Tap to order."*
- **Day 16 — Friction 2 (Rate Limit, Growth mode):** Chinedu broadcasts to all 89 contacts AND runs automated replies simultaneously. Rate limit hit. Messages queue. Customer sends: *"You dey sleep? I don turn to the next person."*

**Recovery:** MarketBoss detects the limit, prioritizes live DMs over queued broadcasts. Push notification: *"⚠️ WhatsApp limit reached. 12 messages queued — sending over 2 hours."* Suggests splitting broadcast list. Angry customer gets response in 15 minutes, buys 2 cases.

##### Negotiation Scene — "Give Me Last Price"
Customer DM: *"Oga, how much for 5 iPhone cases? Give me last price na."* The auto-reply sent ₦4,500 each. But Chinedu gives bulk discount — ₦3,800 for 5+. The AI can't negotiate. MarketBoss shows a "Human Takeover" button — Chinedu taps it, taking over the conversation manually. After negotiation: 5 cases at ₦3,800 = ₦19,000 sale. The system logs the takeover and final price.

##### Customer Segmentation Issue
In Growth broadcast mode, Chinedu sends a ₦4,500 price to EVERYONE — including regular customer Oga Benson who always gets ₦3,500. Benson is furious: *"Since when you dey charge me full price?"* Chinedu realizes he needs segmented broadcast lists: Regular (₦3,500), New (₦4,500), Wholesale (₦3,000). MarketBoss adds contact tagging: regular/new/wholesale with price tier overrides.

##### Attribution Gap
Chinedu can't tell which sales came from MarketBoss vs his existing WhatsApp flow. Solution: conversation tagging — "MarketBoss-originated" vs "Organic." Both tracked for comparison.

##### Climax — Week 3
WhatsApp contacts: 89 → 134. Instagram followers: 12 → 187 (surprise growth from consistent posting). His "sales boy" Emeka takes over Instagram. MarketBoss-attributed sales: ₦73,000.

##### Resolution
Upgrades because Instagram — which he almost ignored — is now his second channel. Customer segmentation prevents pricing conflicts. Human takeover handles negotiations the AI can't.

> **Requirements Revealed:** WhatsApp as primary pipeline choice, WhatsApp Business API verification (realistic 2-6 weeks), Instagram fallback during wait, catalog sync, rate limit detection + graceful degradation, message priority queue, human takeover handoff for negotiations, contact relationship tagging, conversation attribution tagging, plus Growth+ broadcast generation with segmentation (regular/new/wholesale), price tier overrides, and price confirmation before broadcast.

### Journey 3: Tunde's Artisan Discovery (New Persona — Painter)

**Persona:** Tunde Adeyemi | Custom Painter & Muralist | Surulere, Lagos | 890 IG followers | ₦120-300K/month (variable)
**Platform:** Instagram (portfolio), WhatsApp (commissions)

##### Opening Scene — A Quiet Wednesday Morning
Tunde is in his small studio, covered in blue paint. His latest work — a 4×6 foot portrait of a woman in Yoruba braids — leans against the wall. It's stunning. But only 890 people will ever see it. His income is feast or famine — some months 3 commissions (₦300,000), others nothing. He posted twice last month. He sees a MarketBoss ad and scoffs: *"AI? For art? No AI can understand art."*

##### Rising Action — The Skeptical Signup

- **Day 1:** Signs up grudgingly. Brand Voice Onboarding captures his poetic, introspective style: *"Every brushstroke carries a story. This one carries my grandmother's laughter."* AI generates first captions — *"Check out this amazing painting!"* He almost uninstalls. Gives feedback: "More poetic. Talk about the emotion." Second attempt: *"She looked at me the way my grandmother used to — with laughter hiding behind her eyes. Acrylic on canvas, 24×36. This piece is looking for its home."* Impressed but not sold. Edits a few words, schedules it.
- **Day 3:** Post gets 47 likes (avg was 22). Two art collector comments. One DM asking about commissions.

##### Multi-Stage Pipeline
Art doesn't sell like phone cases. Commissions take 2-3 weeks. Standard "inquiry → payment" doesn't fit. Tunde sets up multi-stage deals: (1) Inquiry received → (2) Deposit paid 50% upfront → (3) Work in progress (sends client photo updates) → (4) Final delivery + remaining payment. Pipeline adapts to long sales cycles.

##### Content Collision Scene (Week 2)
Tunde notices @lagosartist's caption: *"In every brushstroke, there's a word my grandfather couldn't say."* His own caption from Tuesday: *"Every brushstroke carries a story. This one carries my grandmother's laughter."* Structurally similar — both use the "brushstroke + ancestor" metaphor. His collectors follow BOTH pages. If they notice, both artists look like they're using templates. Tunde flags it. MarketBoss adds a cross-tenant uniqueness check — pre-publish comparison against recent posts from same-niche tenants. Niche-aware diversification ensures the AI varies metaphors and structures more aggressively within the same domain.

##### Climax — The Commission
Week 2. A mutual friend of a corporate executive shares Tunde's AI-scheduled post. The executive's office manager DMs — they want a mural for their Victoria Island office. Budget: ₦500,000. Tunde processes through MarketBoss: lead card, deposit link. ₦250,000 paid upfront within 2 hours. Largest commission ever landed from social media presence.

##### Resolution — Month 2
Posting: 2/month → 4/week. Followers: 890 → 1,450. Revenue: ₦120K → ₦380K. Now documents painting process in stories (Growth Assist tip: behind-the-scenes content gets 2.3x engagement for creatives).

> **Requirements Revealed:** Brand Voice flexibility (artistic/poetic tones), AI regeneration with user feedback, multi-stage sales pipeline (deposit → progress → final), long sales cycle support, progress update sharing, cross-tenant content uniqueness checking, niche-aware AI diversification, Growth Assist content strategy by account type, high-value lead handling.

---

### Journey 4: Emeka's Delegated Access (Team Member)

**Persona:** Emeka Obi | Chinedu's "Sales Boy" | 19 years old | Computer Village
**Context:** Manages Chinedu's social commerce while Chinedu is away

##### Opening Scene — A Thursday Afternoon
Emeka sits behind Chinedu's counter while Chinedu is at the bank. 3 DMs come in on Instagram. By the time Chinedu returns 2 hours later, one customer already bought from someone else. ₦18,000 gone. Chinedu decides to give Emeka limited MarketBoss access.

##### Rising Action — Onboarding
Chinedu invites Emeka: phone number + email. Permissions set: ✅ View/respond to inquiries, ✅ Create draft posts (approval needed), ✅ Pause auto-replies in emergency, ❌ Publish directly, ❌ View revenue analytics, ❌ Change brand voice or settings. Emeka gets a simplified UI — "Customer Inquiries" tab and "Draft Content" tab only.

- **Day 1:** 4 DMs come in. Emeka uses response templates Chinedu set up. 2 convert to sales. Chinedu sees: *"Emeka responded to 4 inquiries, 2 converted."*
- **Day 2:** Emeka drafts a post: *"New cases don enter!! Come buy now 🔥🔥🔥"* — flagged for Chinedu's approval. Chinedu edits and approves from his phone.

##### Stale Catalog Scene
A customer messages at 11 PM asking about iPhone 15 Pro cases. Auto-reply sends price and "In Stock." But Chinedu sold the last one at 6 PM and didn't update the catalog. The customer arrives next morning — no stock. Chinedu blames Emeka. But Emeka was asleep — the SYSTEM auto-replied. MarketBoss's activity log clearly shows: *"[SYSTEM] Auto-reply sent at 23:04"* vs *"[Emeka] Manual response at 09:15."* The system vs human attribution protects Emeka. Going forward: catalog freshness warning after 6 hours without update, and Emeka has a "Pause Auto-Replies" emergency button.

##### Business Hours Setting
Chinedu configures: auto-replies active 8 AM - 9 PM only. After hours, inquiries are queued with: *"Thanks for your message! We'll respond first thing tomorrow. Office hours: 8 AM - 9 PM."*

##### Performance Visibility
Emeka can see a Performance Dashboard: inquiries handled, response time, conversion rate. But no revenue figures. He knows he handled 11 inquiries and 6 converted — he feels valued without knowing the exact Naira amounts. His *contribution* is visible without exposing business financials.

##### Climax — The Trust Test
Chinedu is sick for 2 days. Emeka handles everything: 11 inquiries, 6 sales, 2 draft posts (approved remotely). Revenue: ₦42,000. The business didn't stop.

##### Resolution
Emeka becomes full-time team member. Eventually asks Chinedu about getting his own MarketBoss account for a side business selling phone accessories online — the upgrade path from team member to independent user.

> **Requirements Revealed:** Team invitation (phone/email), granular permissions (view/respond/draft/publish/analytics/settings), simplified role-based UI, response templates, draft → approval → publish workflow, remote approval (mobile), team activity log with system vs human attribution, performance metrics without revenue disclosure, catalog freshness warnings, emergency "Pause Auto-Replies" permission, business hours configuration, team member → own account upgrade path.

### Journey 5: Aniekan's Ops Morning (Admin/Operations — Month 4-6)

**Persona:** Aniekan Ibraheem | MarketBoss Founder & Platform Admin | + Seyi (Operations Team Member)
**Context:** Month 5, 340 active users. Admin tooling built during Growth phase (post-MVP).

##### Opening Scene — Monday, 7:15 AM
Admin Dashboard loads. Overnight metrics: 🟢 Uptime: 99.7% (Paystack maintenance dip at 3 AM), 🟡 AI API usage: 54% of rate limit, 🟢 Active users (7-day): 298/340 (87.6%), 🔴 3 urgent support tickets, 📊 New signups: 12 (above 8/day target). Concern: AI cost per user trending up — 28% of subscription revenue (target ≤30%).

##### Rising Action — The Operational Day

- **8:00 AM — Tickets:** (1) "FashionByChika" — wrong photos on posts (image mismatch bug → dev team), (2) "GraceBeautyHQ" — payment link broken (Seyi finds expired Paystack API key, re-authenticates), (3) "KingsAutoparts" — account deletion request (NDPA: must process within 72 hours).
- **11:00 AM — Compliance Dashboard:** 340/340 valid NDPA consent records. 15 inactive accounts need data archival (90-day policy). Processes KingsAutoparts deletion: data archived, personal data removed, confirmation sent, audit trail logged. Completed in 42 hours.
- **2:00 PM — User Health Review:** 23 users with declining engagement (auto-triggered Growth Assist), 8 users inactive 7+ days (win-back email triggered), 4 Reach Protection alerts → investigates one: "AbikeStyles" reach dropped 40% — timezone detection bug causing 2 AM posts.

##### Content Moderation Scene
A fashion brand's AI-generated post used a watermarked stock photo. The stock photo provider sends a takedown request via email. Aniekan checks the content moderation queue — the image was uploaded by the user, not generated by AI. He removes the post, notifies the user, and adds automated watermark detection to the content upload pipeline to prevent future incidents.

##### Climax — The Scaling Decision (4 PM)
Seyi reports: AI costs at 28% will blow past 30% at 500 users. Starter tier users averaging 45 AI calls/day (3x model). Options: (A) Throttle Starter, (B) Aggressive caching, (C) Raise price, (D) Cap at 30 calls/day for Starter. Chooses D + cache optimization (34% → 50% hit rate target).

##### Resolution
Bug fixes deployed, deletion processed, cost containment active. Seyi handles Tier 1 support independently. 14 new users this week. Platform stable.

> **Requirements Revealed (Growth Phase):** Admin Dashboard (real-time health, AI usage, user metrics), support ticket management with urgency flags, compliance dashboard (NDPA consent, deletions, retention), audit trail, user health monitoring (engagement trends, churn risk, reach protection), AI cost analytics per-tier, tenant-level debugging, content moderation pipeline (watermark detection, takedown handling), rate limiting / tier-based feature gating.

### Journey 6: Blessing's Support Call (Support/Troubleshooting)

**Persona:** Blessing Adamu | Food Vendor | Abuja | TikTok + Instagram | ₦100-180K/month
**Situation:** 3 weeks into MarketBoss, her engagement has DROPPED.

##### Opening Scene — Week 3, Angry and Confused
Before MarketBoss: avg 45 likes, 8 comments per post. After 3 weeks of AI content: 28 likes, 3 comments. She feels tricked. Opens the app, taps "Help," sends a **voice note**: *"Please o, this your app is spoiling my business. My customers are not seeing my posts anymore!"*

##### Rising Action — The Investigation

Support system transcribes voice note (with Nigerian accent handling — transcription runs through accent-adapted model, with manual review fallback if confidence is low). Auto-tags: 🔴 Reach Protection Alert.

Seyi picks up the ticket and investigates:

1. **Baseline Check:** Pre-MarketBoss avg: 45 likes, 2.8% engagement. Current: 28 likes, 1.7%. Reach Protection fired at Day 14 — but Blessing had app notifications OFF. Alert was only in-app. **Gap identified:** needed multi-channel alerts (WhatsApp + SMS, not just push).
2. **Content Analysis:** Original posts used Pidgin: *"See this jollof na! ₦2,500 per plate 🍚🔥"* — AI posted proper English: *"Delicious jollof rice available for delivery. Order now for just ₦2,500."* Brand Voice Engine scored 72% match (below 80% threshold), but alert only fires for new posts, not retroactively.
3. **Root Cause:** Brand Voice Onboarding incomplete — Blessing only pasted 2 captions (minimum is 5). AI defaulted to generic marketing language. Incomplete onboarding detection should have caught this.

##### Climax — The Fix
Seyi calls Blessing on WhatsApp (voice call — Blessing prefers voice to text). Gets 8 old captions. Runs "Recalibrate Brand Voice" from admin panel. Also recommends archiving 3 worst-performing AI posts to reduce algorithm penalty from low-engagement content.

##### The Damage Radius
During the bad 3 weeks, Blessing told 5 market friends: *"Don't use that MarketBoss thing, it spoiled my business."* After the fix works, Blessing tells the same 5 friends the recovery story. Two of them sign up — the "save story" becomes more powerful than a normal referral because it demonstrates responsive support.

##### Resolution — Week 4
New AI post: *"This jollof go change your afternoon 🍚😋 Small chops dey too. ₦2,500 per plate, delivery straight to your office. DM 'ORDER' make I serve you 🔥"* — 52 likes, 11 comments (above baseline). Blessing: *"Ah! This one sounds like ME!"* Notifications turned back on. Becomes an advocate.

> **Requirements Revealed:** Voice note support with Nigerian accent transcription (+ manual fallback), multi-channel Reach Protection alerts (push + WhatsApp + SMS), brand voice recalibration tool (admin-initiated), incomplete onboarding detection (flag <5 captions), retroactive content style audit, low-engagement content cleanup recommendations, support agent access to user analytics + content history, WhatsApp/voice-first support channel, referral sentiment tracking ("save stories").

---

### Journey 7: Dare's API Integration (Developer — Month 4-6)

**Persona:** Dare Ogunlade | Freelance Developer | Lagos
**Context:** Building inventory sync for fashion brand "NaijaThreads" (5,000 IG followers, Pro tier). Partner API beta is available in Growth; public Open API follows in Phase 3.

##### Opening Scene — API Discovery
NaijaThreads already uses MarketBoss for content scheduling but has a custom inventory system Dare built. Currently someone manually uploads new products. Client wants: *"When I add a product, it should auto-generate content and schedule a post."*

##### Rising Action — The Integration Build

- **Day 1:** Registers partner API key via Developer Portal (beta access). Reviews docs: `POST /api/v1/content/generate`, `POST /api/v1/schedule`, `GET /api/v1/analytics/post/{id}`, `POST /api/v1/leads`, `GET /api/v1/brand-voice/{tenant_id}`.
- **Day 2:** Builds webhook: inventory update → MarketBoss content generation → schedule → lead card creation. **Friction 1:** API rate limit is 100 calls/hour on Pro. Stock days = 15-20 products at once. Finds batch endpoint: `POST /api/v1/content/generate/batch` (up to 50 products/call). **Friction 2:** Price sent as number (12500), AI doesn't format as ₦12,500. Fixed in middleware.
- **Day 3:** Sandbox testing. Everything works.

##### API Versioning Scene (Month 8)
MarketBoss announces v2 API — new content generation model with better brand voice. Dare receives developer notification 60 days before deprecation. Migration guide provides diff between v1 and v2 response formats. Dare updates his middleware in 2 hours. Client sees no disruption. Developer support channel (separate from user support) handles his technical questions directly.

##### Climax — Going Live
18 new dresses added to inventory. Within 60 seconds: 18 AI captions generated (3 options each), 18 posts scheduled across 5 days (optimal slots), 18 lead cards created. Engagement jumps 35%.

##### Resolution
Dare builds 3 more integrations. Becomes a "MarketBoss Integration Partner" in developer directory. Charges ₦150,000 per setup. Client sales up 40%.

> **Requirements Revealed (Growth + Scale):** Partner API beta in Growth (content, scheduling, analytics, leads, brand voice), developer portal with API key management, API rate limiting per tier with batch endpoints, sandbox environment, webhook support, API versioning with deprecation policy (60-day notice), developer notification system, developer support channel (separate from user support), migration tooling, and public Open API in Scale.

### Journey Requirements Summary

| Capability Area | Requirements | Source Journeys | Phase |
|----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Onboarding & Setup** | Brand Voice capture (min 5 captions), incomplete onboarding detection, pre-MarketBoss baseline capture, WhatsApp/IG pipeline choice, WhatsApp API verification with IG fallback, team invitation | 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 | MVP |
| **Content Engine** | AI generation + regenerate with feedback, smart scheduling, content variation (AI detection resistance), style match scoring, brand voice recalibration, cross-tenant uniqueness check, niche-aware diversification, batch generation | 1, 3, 6, 7 | MVP + Growth |
| **Sales Pipeline** | Inquiry capture (DM → Lead Card), payment link generation, multi-stage deals (deposit → progress → final), cross-platform tracking (IG → WhatsApp → payment), mixed attribution (MarketBoss vs organic), response templates, human takeover handoff for negotiations | 1, 2, 3, 4 | MVP + Growth |
| **Channel Management** | Instagram + WhatsApp pipelines, WhatsApp catalog sync, business hours config, and rate-limit-safe DM handling in MVP; broadcast generation, segmentation (regular/new/wholesale), price tier overrides, broadcast frequency limits, and queue controls in Growth+ | 2 | MVP + Growth |
| **Growth Assist** | Engagement prompts, content strategy by account type, behind-the-scenes suggestions, hashtag/timing optimization | 1, 3 | MVP |
| **Team Management** | Granular permissions, simplified role-based UI, draft → approval → publish, remote approval, team activity log, system vs human attribution, performance metrics (without revenue), catalog freshness warnings, "Pause Auto-Replies" emergency, team → own account upgrade path | 4 | MVP |
| **Admin & Operations** | Admin dashboard, ticket management, user health monitoring, AI cost analytics, tenant debugging, compliance dashboard (NDPA), audit trail, content moderation pipeline (watermarks, takedowns), rate limiting controls | 5 | Growth |
| **Support** | Voice note transcription (Nigerian accent), multi-channel alerts (push + WhatsApp + SMS), brand voice recalibration, content audit (retroactive), low-engagement cleanup, WhatsApp/voice-first support, referral sentiment tracking | 6 | MVP + Growth |
| **API & Integration** | Partner API beta + developer portal (Growth), then public Open API + partner ecosystem tooling (Scale) | 7 | Growth + Scale |

> **Key Insight (Assumption Mapping):** 61% of journey assumptions remain untested. Top risks: Nigerian commerce is negotiation-based (not fixed-price as pipelines assume), voice-to-text for Nigerian accents is technically challenging, cross-platform inquiry tracking (IG discover → WhatsApp buy) crosses platform boundaries, and Admin/API tooling requires significant Growth-phase investment beyond MVP.
