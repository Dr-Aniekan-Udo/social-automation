# Product Scope

### MVP — Minimum Viable Product (Months 1-3)

Must ship to prove the concept works:

1. **Account Setup & Verification** — User onboarding, KYC (basic tier), social account linking
2. **Brand Voice Onboarding** — Capture user's existing posting style, tone, and language during signup. AI adapts to their voice, not generic marketing
3. **Pre-MarketBoss Baseline Capture** — Record 30 days of pre-adoption metrics (reach, engagement, follower count) at signup to measure real impact
4. **One Complete Social Pipeline** — Instagram end-to-end is the MVP launch baseline (connect → create AI content → schedule → post → track engagement); WhatsApp is included in MVP only if API approval clears during the build window, otherwise enabled immediately after approval. Facebook posting is deferred to Growth.
5. **AI Content Generation** — Caption, hashtag optimization, image suggestions — calibrated to user's brand voice and Nigerian market context
6. **Sales Pipeline** — Customer inquiry capture → lead tracking → payment link generation → sale completion
7. **Basic Analytics** — Post performance, engagement rate, sales conversion tracking, pre/post baseline comparison, reach protection alerts
8. **Compliance Foundation** — NDPA consent management, privacy proxy for AI calls, data encryption, formal legal review
9. **Growth Assist (Basic)** — Posting time suggestions, hashtag recommendations, community engagement prompts, follower growth tracking
10. **Team Access (Basic)** — Invite team member with approval workflow for post scheduling
11. **Inquiry Attribution** — Track which customer inquiries came from which AI-generated posts

> **Decision: Channel rollout policy** — MVP ships Instagram-first by default due WhatsApp approval uncertainty (2-6 weeks). If WhatsApp Business API approval lands during the MVP build window, include WhatsApp inbox + payment-link flows in MVP; otherwise release WhatsApp immediately post-approval with Instagram as the active baseline at launch.

> **Pricing Strategy:** 7-day free trial recommended to address extreme price sensitivity (Focus Group + Competitive Analysis: Bumpa has a free tier). Money-back guarantee as fallback if free trial not viable.

> **Competitive Context:** Bumpa (62/100) is the primary competitor. They win on payments + WhatsApp. MarketBoss wins on AI + sales pipeline (83/100). Buffer/Hootsuite (42/100) are not competitive for Nigerian social commerce.

> **Sprint Breakdown:** See [Phase 1 Sprint Plan](#phase-1-mvp--ai-commerce-engine-8-weeks) for detailed 4-sprint implementation, feature specifications, and resource estimates.
