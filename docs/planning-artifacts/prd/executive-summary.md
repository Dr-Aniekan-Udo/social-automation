# Executive Summary

**Product:** MarketBoss — an AI-powered social commerce platform for Nigerian micro-SMB sellers.

**Vision:** Every social media post becomes a sales opportunity. MarketBoss generates content in the seller's unique voice, embeds payment links, tracks customer journeys from post to payment, and automates the conversation-to-cash workflow across Instagram and WhatsApp.

**Target Users:** Nigerian small business owners and artisans (₦100K–350K/month revenue, 200–5,000 followers) who sell via Instagram DMs and WhatsApp — currently spending 2+ hours daily on content creation and losing sales to unanswered messages.

**Core Differentiator:** First platform to integrate AI Brand Voice content generation + payment escrow + cross-platform attribution + negotiation handoff into a single workflow purpose-built for Nigerian social commerce. Competitors (Bumpa, Buffer, Selar) address individual capabilities; none combine all four.

**Revenue Model:** Freemium subscription (₦0–₦15,000/month) + 3% commission on completed transactions (Paystack in MVP, optional escrow + dual-gateway support from Growth).
