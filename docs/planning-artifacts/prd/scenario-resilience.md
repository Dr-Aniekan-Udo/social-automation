# Scenario Resilience

Success criteria have been stress-tested against three scenarios:

| Scenario | Description | Key Risk | Mitigation Built Into Criteria |
|----------|------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 🚀 **Viral Wave** | 5,000 signups in 48 hours after TikTok mention | Infrastructure + AI cost explosion | Scalability headroom (≤ 60% API limits), AI cost cap (≤ 30%) |
| 📈 **Steady Grind** | On-target growth but constant marketing effort | Organic growth stalls, competitive window narrows | CAC trend tracking, competitive health tracker, referral targets |
| 🌪️ **Platform Storm** | Meta API restrictions + NDPC enforcement action | Pipeline broken, churn spike, legal scramble | Crisis churn ceiling (≤ 8%), pipeline failover (≤ 4h), regulatory SLA (14 days), platform concentration (≤ 60%) |
