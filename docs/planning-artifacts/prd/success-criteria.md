# Success Criteria

### User Success

| Criteria | Metric | Target | Source |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **First Value Moment** | Time from signup to first customer inquiry attributed to AI content | ≤ 3 days | Focus Group + 5 Whys |
| **First Automated Sale** | Time from signup to first completed sale via platform | ≤ 7 days | User input |
| **Inquiry Attribution** | Customer inquiries trackable to specific AI-generated posts | 100% of platform inquiries tagged | Focus Group |

| **Engagement Lift** | Engagement rate improvement vs. user's pre-MarketBoss baseline | > 50% improvement in 60 days | Pre-mortem |
| **Follower Growth** | Monthly follower growth rate on connected accounts | > 10% MoM for active users | 5 Whys |
| **Time Saved** | Hours saved per week on content creation + posting + customer management | ≥ 5 hours/week | Brief §1 |
| **Ease of Delegation** | Team members can create, schedule, and post with approval workflow | Functional from MVP | Focus Group |
| **Brand Voice Fidelity** | AI content naturalness score — "does this sound like me?" | ≥ 80% user approval on generated content | Support Theater |
| **Nigerian Authenticity** | AI content passes local context test (slang, holidays, pricing conventions) | Flagged as "authentic" by ≥ 85% of Nigerian test users | Red Team |
| **First, Do No Harm** | User's reach/engagement must NOT decrease after adopting MarketBoss | Reach ≥ pre-MarketBoss baseline within 14 days | Support Theater |
| **Community Engagement** | Platform provides daily engagement prompts (reply to comments, engage with community) | ≥ 3 prompts/day for active users | Support Theater |
| **User Confidence Score** | "Do you feel in control of what MarketBoss posts?" (in-app survey) | ≥ 4/5 rating | Empathy Map |
| **Emotional Satisfaction** | Stress reduction + confidence improvement (CSAT survey) | ≥ 4.2/5 | Empathy Map |
| **Day 28 Retention** | User still actively using platform at end of first billing cycle | ≥ 70% of paid users | Empathy Map |

> **Key Insight (5 Whys Root Cause):** Users churn when they don't see sales, not when they lack features. Root cause: small accounts (200–2K followers) lack the audience to convert even great content into revenue. MarketBoss must automate audience GROWTH alongside content OUTPUT — Growth Assist is core, not optional.

> **Key Insight (Support Theater):** AI content must capture the user's EXISTING voice, not impose generic marketing language. A style change triggers algorithm penalties and follower loss. Brand voice calibration during onboarding is essential.

### Measurable Outcomes

- **North Star Metric:** Completed sales per user per month (measures full conversation-to-cash loop)

- **Churn Predictor:** Users whose engagement rate drops below 1% for 2 consecutive weeks → trigger proactive Growth Assist intervention
- **Data Flywheel Metric:** Per-tenant posting optimization outperforms generic platform defaults (validates competitive moat — target: measurable by Month 6 with sufficient data)
- **Moat Activation Metric:** Algorithm Intelligence Engine outperforms generic recommendations by >20% engagement rate (validates defensible competitive advantage)
- **Competitive Health Tracker:** Quarterly assessment — MarketBoss maintains unique "AI + Sales Pipeline" position vs Bumpa and new entrants
- **Trust Journey Tracker:** Track users through stages: Skeptical → Trying → Cautious → Confident → Advocate (Empathy Map)
- **Emotional ROI:** Users report reduced stress + increased business confidence alongside functional metrics (Empathy Map)
